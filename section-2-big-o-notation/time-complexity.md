#Objective

- The need for something like Big O
- What is Big O notation
- Simplify Big O expressions
- Define time complexity and space complexity
- Evaluate the time complexity and space complexity of different algorithms using Big O notation
- What id a logarithm? 


##Definition
- An algorithm is O(f(n)) if the number of simple operations the computer has todo is eventually less than a constatnt times f(n), as n increases

##Big O Shorthands
1. Arithmetic operations are constant: adding, subtracting, ... are just a constant time, it doesn't matter the size of the number
2. Variable assignment is constant
3. Accessing element in array (by index) or object (by key) is constant
4. In a loop, the complexity is the length of the loop times the complexity of whatever happens inside of the loop
