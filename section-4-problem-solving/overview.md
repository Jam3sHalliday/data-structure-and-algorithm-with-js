# Algorithms and Problem Solving Patterns - Overview
- This chapter is about making "have no idea" problems solvable!

## OBJECTIVES
- Define what an algorithm is 
- Devise a plan to solve algorithm
- Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two poiter problems and divide and conquer

### What is an algorithm?
- A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task. -- a set of mathematical steps that we need to do to solve the problem

### Why do I need to know this?
- Almost everything that you do ing programming involves some kind of algorithms!

### How do you improve?
- Devise a plan for solving problems
- Master common problem solving patterns

### What is this "part 1" about?
- Understand the problem
- Explore concrete exmaples
- Break it down
- Solve / Simplify
- Look back and refactor
