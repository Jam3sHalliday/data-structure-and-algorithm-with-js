Hi,  
I'm Quang,  
This is the begining of my journey, to improve my skills  
and here is the my map :D  

- [x] Data Structure & Algorithm
- [x] Advanced Reactjs
- [x] Nodejs
- [x] Docker
- [x] AWS

I'll try to learn, commit my progress everyday, more or less, I will make it to become a marathon!

And about this course, it's a Data Structure and Algorithm with Javascript course, 22 hours in length, and this topic currently is one of my weakness
Okay, time to fix it! :D


I write this for myself, if someone (not me) read this, ... sorry for my bad english :v
